Hello and welcome to my career portfolio website! Here you can find info about me, my highlighted projects, repositories, resume, skills, and Github. I also plan to share any updates on projects or code that I am currently working on.

This portfolio uses the Lanyon theme and all credit for the creation of the theme goes to its creator(s).
